# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements user authentication functionality for the Yellow project management platform, including user registration, login, and session management. The authentication system will serve as the foundation for multi-tenant workspace access and role-based permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with my email and password, so that I can access the Yellow platform and join workspaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error message
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
5. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response with user information (excluding password)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my workspaces and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user provides a non-existent email THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
4. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token and user information
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL set appropriate session cookies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be maintained securely, so that I don't have to re-authenticate frequently while using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token
2. WHEN a JWT token is expired THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
3. WHEN a JWT token is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session
5. IF a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL include user context in all requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my password to be stored securely, so that my account remains protected even if there's a data breach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers or changes password THEN the system SHALL hash the password using bcrypt
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL never store plain text passwords
3. WHEN comparing passwords THEN the system SHALL use secure comparison methods
4. WHEN generating JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL use a secure secret key
5. WHEN setting cookies THEN the system SHALL use secure and httpOnly flags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication middleware available, so that I can protect routes that require user authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing protected routes THEN the system SHALL provide authentication middleware
2. WHEN a request lacks authentication THEN the middleware SHALL return unauthorized status
3. WHEN authentication is valid THEN the middleware SHALL attach user information to the request
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the middleware SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. IF a route requires authentication THEN the middleware SHALL be easily applicable
