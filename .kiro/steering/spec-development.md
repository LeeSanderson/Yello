# Spec Development Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for creating comprehensive feature specifications that include proper testing requirements.

## Spec Creation Requirements

### Task Planning Standards
When creating implementation plans for specs, follow these mandatory requirements:

1. **Every implementation task MUST be followed by a corresponding unit test task**
2. **Test tasks must include verification that tests pass**
3. **Integration tests must be included for API endpoints**
4. **End-to-end tests must be included for complete workflows**
5. **Test tasks must reference the same requirements as implementation tasks**

### Task Structure Template
Use this structure for all implementation tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] X.Y Implement [functionality]
  - Write [specific functionality] implementation
  - Handle [specific scenarios and edge cases]
  - _Requirements: [requirement references]_

- [ ] X.Z Write unit tests for [functionality]
  - Test [specific functionality] with valid inputs
  - Test [specific functionality] with invalid inputs
  - Test error handling scenarios
  - Run tests to verify [functionality] works correctly
  - _Requirements: [same requirement references as implementation]_
```

### Required Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (Mandatory for all tasks)
- Must test individual functions, classes, and methods in isolation
- Must include happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Must verify functionality works correctly before moving to next task
- Must be placed immediately after the implementation task they test

#### Integration Tests (Mandatory for API endpoints)
- Must test interactions between components
- Must test database operations with proper setup/teardown
- Must test authentication and authorization scenarios
- Must test error handling and proper HTTP status codes

#### End-to-End Tests (Mandatory for complete workflows)
- Must test complete user workflows from start to finish
- Must test realistic user scenarios
- Must verify the entire system works together correctly

### Test Verification Requirements
Every test task must include:
- Specific test scenarios to be covered
- "Run tests to verify [functionality] works correctly" as a requirement
- Reference to the same requirements as the implementation task
- Clear success criteria for test completion

### Quality Assurance
- Tests must be written using the project's testing framework (Bun for backend, Vitest for frontend)
- Tests must achieve reasonable code coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Tests must be maintainable and follow project conventions
- Tests must run quickly and reliably

## Implementation Workflow

### Task Execution Order
1. Implement functionality
2. Write and run unit tests immediately
3. Verify tests pass before proceeding
4. Move to next implementation task
5. Repeat cycle

### Test-First Approach (Recommended)
- Consider writing tests before or alongside implementation
- Use tests to drive the design of the implementation
- Ensure tests fail initially, then pass after implementation

### Continuous Verification
- Run tests after each implementation step
- Fix any failing tests before proceeding
- Maintain test suite health throughout development

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Documentation
- Document complex test scenarios and their purpose
- Explain any special test setup or teardown requirements
- Document test data factories and utilities used

### Requirement Traceability
- Ensure every requirement has corresponding tests
- Link test tasks to specific requirement numbers
- Verify test coverage addresses all acceptance criteria

## Common Patterns

### Service Layer Testing
```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Implement user registration service
  - Write user registration logic with email uniqueness validation
  - Implement password hashing before database storage
  - Create user creation with proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 2.2 Write unit tests for user registration service
  - Test registration with valid user data
  - Test email uniqueness validation
  - Test password hashing integration
  - Test error handling for invalid inputs
  - Run tests to verify registration service works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2_
```

### API Endpoint Testing
```markdown
- [ ] 5.1 Create user registration endpoint
  - Implement POST /api/auth/register route handler
  - Integrate input validation and registration service
  - Return appropriate success and error responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 5.2 Write unit tests for user registration endpoint
  - Test registration endpoint with valid user data
  - Test registration endpoint with invalid email formats
  - Test registration endpoint with weak passwords
  - Test registration endpoint with duplicate emails
  - Run tests to verify registration endpoint works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_
```

### Middleware Testing
```markdown
- [ ] 4.1 Implement JWT authentication middleware
  - Write middleware to extract and validate JWT tokens from requests
  - Attach user context to authenticated requests
  - Handle token expiration and invalid token scenarios
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 4.2 Write unit tests for JWT authentication middleware
  - Test token extraction from Authorization header
  - Test user context attachment for valid tokens
  - Test error handling for expired and invalid tokens
  - Test middleware behavior with missing tokens
  - Run tests to verify authentication middleware works correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
```

## Spec Review Checklist

Before finalizing any spec, verify:
- [ ] Every implementation task has a corresponding test task
- [ ] Test tasks include "Run tests to verify [functionality] works correctly"
- [ ] Test tasks reference the same requirements as implementation tasks
- [ ] Integration tests are included for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests are included for complete workflows
- [ ] Test scenarios cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- [ ] Test tasks are positioned immediately after implementation tasks

This ensures comprehensive testing coverage and reliable feature development.
